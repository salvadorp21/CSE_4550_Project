            <h2>What is a Powerlifter Physique?</h2>
            <p>
                Powerlifters have a unique physique that combines muscular bulk with exceptional strength. They focus on building power and endurance rather than a sculpted, lean appearance.
                Common characteristics include well-developed thighs, hips, back, and a strong core. While powerlifters often maintain a higher body fat percentage than bodybuilders, their muscle density and strength are unmatched.

            <h2>Powerlifter Diet Plan</h2>
            <p>
                A powerlifting diet is designed to provide the energy and protein needed for intense training while promoting muscle growth and recovery. 
                Here’s a sample diet plan for powerlifters:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Protein:</strong> 1.2-1.6 grams per pound of body weight from sources like chicken, lean beef, eggs, and plant-based proteins.</li>
                <li><strong>Carbohydrates:</strong> 3-4 grams per pound, especially from whole grains, sweet potatoes, and vegetables, to fuel workouts.</li>
                <li><strong>Fats:</strong> 0.4-0.6 grams per pound from sources like olive oil, nuts, and avocados.</li>
                <li><strong>Hydration:</strong> Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated, especially during workouts.</li>
            </ul>
